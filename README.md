# Frontend for JavasScript Parser and Runtime

This will be composed of a simple custom code editor and another area to display the parsed JavaScript abstract syntax tree as well as a simple console for displaying the executed JavaScript code. It's designed to interact with the future backend here: https://github.com/JosephRodolfo/Basic-JavaScript-Interpreter

I also wanted to try building some typical web UI things in React I haven't had the chance to make in the past like sliders and tabbed content so you can have multiple code editor pages open at once.
